# Enterprise Recommendation System (Ads & Content)

## Overview

This repository implements an end-to-end recommendation system pipeline for ads and content ranking.  
The system is designed to reflect how modern recommender systems are **built, trained, evaluated, and iterated** in real-world environments.

The project covers:
- Synthetic but realistic data generation
- Multiple embedding models
- Candidate retrieval at scale
- Feature-rich ranking
- Offline and online evaluation
- Cold-start handling
- Bandit-based exploration
- Hybrid embeddings
- Multi-objective optimization
- Simulated real-time feedback loop

The codebase is modular, extensible, and intentionally structured to support experimentation and model comparisons.
